# Caterpeeler 🐛
 
You are the Caterpeeler! Wiggle around a tree branch and eat leaves to become a beautiful butterfly! Dodge the spiders and make sure to hide from the ominous birds flying around the tree by going under piles of leaves.

Made for the CSSA Game Jam 2019 at the University of Manitoba in less than 48 hours. The theme for the game jam was "1 HP". You can download a playable build of the game on [itch.io](https://markrobitaille.itch.io/caterpeeler). Extract the files from the zip file and open caterpeeler.exe to start playing.
